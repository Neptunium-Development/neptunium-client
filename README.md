## Neptunium Utility Mod

# About
We are happily introducing **Neptunium**, our new Utility Mod for Minecraft Fabric!

Neptunium is currently under *very* heavy development and is a *powerful* Utility Mod that focuses mostly on *ghost and blatant modules*.

Best of everything, Neptunium is 100% open-source, so there's no need to worry about viruses or other security risks. :microbe: :no_entry_sign:

Want to learn more about **Neptunium** or download it for yourself? Check out our website at *coming soon* There, you'll find a button that will take you to the **source code** as well as a direct download button that links you to our GitHub!

If you would like to contact support or suggest something you can DM heedi#3560!

For the base of this client we will be using VapeMenu.

Thanks for checking out Neptunium and happy *modding!*
